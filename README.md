Because one day I may have a burning need to know what Millennium was serving for brunch in June 2019

This is my very first bit of code that I'm posting publicly. I intend to use this account to track my progress as I learn, 
so I'll be using the README files to record questions for a future me who can answer them.

(Or, if you're reading this and you'd like to answer some of them for me, please do!)

1. The import list to code ratio seems excessive. Are all of those import statements really necessary? Is using 
FileOutputStream, FileWriter, BufferedWriter, and File in the same program somehow redundant?

2. Should I be handling the possibility of there being a problem while creating the directory more gracefully?

3. Is there a more elegant way to write the code to clean up Millennium's menu?

4. My methods for finding the pdf menu links are pretty brittle. If I understood HTML better, how would I improve them?
